The CR toolbox provides an easy, user-oriented, matlab package to compute the optical flow and feature tracking from video.

In particular, this toolbox contains the following features:

 - KLT feature tracker (Tomasi-Kanade feature detector & Lucas-Kanade tracking)
 - Optical flow from either KLT or image correlation (using the additional MatPIV toolbox)
 - Bi-Orthogonal Decomposition of optical flow or tracked features
 - A player to display all results
 - A full set of user interfaces

###Project

This toolbox has been developped in a collaboration between

 - [LadHyX](http://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/) lab of Ecole Polytechnique
 - [Piaf](http://www6.clermont.inra.fr/piaf) team of INRA
 - [Evasion ](http://www-evasion.imag.fr/) team of INRIA

It was founded by the [ANR research project Chêne-Roseau](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/projet-anr/?tx_lwmsuivibilan_pi2%5BCODE%5D=ANR-06-BLAN-0210)  

The implementation has been done by [Julien Diener](https://github.com/julien-diener).
